## Projects
### URL Classification With Logistic Regression
'''
- Built a model from scratch using **pyspark's** library to determine whether a URL is malicious or benign based on a set of features compiled by vectorassembler.
- Features were identified by the output of a heatmap using **numpy's** library that correlated the highest impact of all viable columns to the target label column.
- Fine-tuned different learning algorithms by the usage of ensemble techniques and OneVsRest.
