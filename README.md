# Personal Purpose
This page is created to reflect on my journey through the field of Information Technology and other disciplines such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
I'll be uploading my projects that I work on here and solutions of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges from my own point of view, to showcase my methodology & knowledge.

## Projects
### URL Classification With Logistic Regression - Supervised ML
>Built a model from scratch using **pyspark's** framework to determine whether a URL is malicious or benign based on a set of selected features.
>
>Features were identified by the output of a heatmap using **numpy's** and **sklearn's** libraries that correlated the highest impact of all viable columns to the target label column.
>
>Fine-tuned different learning algorithms by the usage of ensemble techniques and different classifiers such as OneVsRest, etc.

### Rice Seed Classification - Machine Vision
>Built a neural network from scratch as part of my studies for my A.I - Machine Vision course, later on I moved on to configuring a pre-trained neural network using GoogleNet's network.
>
>Configured input layers and output layers respectively according to the number of classes existing in the dataset, set parameters to validate the learning process.
>
>Fine-tuned the network by adding accuracy and F1 score metrics to cross-validate, and configured a confusion matrix using MATLAB to analyze the results.
