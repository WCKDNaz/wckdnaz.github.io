# Bandit Wargame Walkthrough - OverTheWire
Disclaimer: As this is an on-going challenge and the flags (passwords) for each level are reset on a regular basis, I won't be disclosing them here, I'll only disclose the theory and methods that I used to be able to get to the solution, I see this as a much better way for all of us to learn and see how each one's mind tries to grasp and build on ideas of abstraction.
## Level 0 --> 1:
``` 
- Simply use cat on the file `readme`
$ cat readme
```
## Level 1 --> 2
```
- If a file has a special character in it, use tab auto-complete to bypass
```
## Level 2 --> 3
```
- Same as previous level, tab auto-complete is a life saver in linux
```
## Level 3 --> 4
```
- Recall that the `ls` command can show hidden files by appending `-a` option to show all.
$ ls -a
```
